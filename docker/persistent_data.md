Containers are meant to be immutable and ephemeral. 

They are build around the idea of immutable infrastructure, meaning that if you need a container to perform differently, you don't modify the running container, you create a new image with that defined functionality and deploy containers from the new image. 

Because of this nature of containers, working with data that exists outside of the container, or with data that was generated by the running container, can be difficult. 

Fortunately, Docker provides us with two solutions:  `Volumes` and `Bind mounts`. 

Volumes provide a way to link data internal to the container to a special location outside of the container.  

Bind mounts link a container path to a host path.
