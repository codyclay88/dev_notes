## What is a distrubted system?

A distributed system is a group of computers that work together as to appear as a single computer to the end-user. 

The computers in a distributed system can either be in the same local network or on geographically distant networks. They have a shared state, operate concurrently, and can fail independently without affecting the whole system's uptime. 

## Why distribute a syste?
Systems are always distributed by necessity - managing distributed systems is a complex topic. It can be a headache to deploy, maintain, and debug distributed systems. 

With all this said, distributed systems enables some interesting abilities, such as the following:
- Horizontal Scaling
- Fault tolerance
- Low latency
