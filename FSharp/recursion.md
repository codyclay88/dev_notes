# Understanding Recursion through Lists

#### This post attempts to explain how recursion can be a powerful tool when programming in a functional style. To put things in a useful context, I will be going over how recursion can be used with Lists in F#. 

Recursion is one of those scary things that we are taught in school, and we learn just enough to memorize the examples (factorial, Fibonacci) and pass the test. 

But what if I told you that recursion could be more than that? What if it was actually a powerful tool that we could use every day?

Before I explain my blasphemous claim, let's do what any sensible blog post trying to gather credibility would do: quote Wikipedia. 

Wikipedia tells us that *recursion* occurs when a thing is defined in terms of **itself or of it's type**. While pretty general, I think there is something to be learned from this. Let's break it down a bit.
- a thing -- since we are talking about programming (in particular with F#), this is either referring to a function or a type.
- defined in terms of itself -- what we all learned in school, a function can call itself
- or it's type -- a data structure can be composed of instances of itself, where those instances are composed of more instances of itself, and so on and so on.
