CQL offers a model close to SQL in the sense that data is put in tables containing rows of columns. For that reason, when used in this document, these terms (tables, rows, and columns) have the same definition than they have in SQL. 

CQL consists of statements that can be divided in the following categories:
- Data Definition, to define and change how the data is stored (keyspaces and tables)
- Data Manipulation, for selecting, inserting, and deleting data
- Secondary Index 
- Materialized Views 
- Database Roles
- Permissions
- User-defined Functions
- User-defined Types
- Triggers
