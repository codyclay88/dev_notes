Azure CosmosDB Cassandra API can be used as the data store for apps written for Apache Cassandra. This means that by using existing Apache drivers compliant with CQLv4, your existing Cassandra application can now communicate with the Azure CosmosDB Cassandra API. In many cases, you can switch from using Apache Cassandra to using Azure Cosmos DB's Cassandra API by just changing a connection string. 

The Cassandra API enables you to interact with data stored in Azure Cosmos DB using the Cassandra Query Language, Cassandra based tools (such as cqlsh) and Cassandra client drivers that you are already familiar with.
