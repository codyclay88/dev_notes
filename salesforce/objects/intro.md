Salesforce revolves around the idea of objects. Objects represent types of data in our system. There are many types of objects already provided by Salesforce, such as Accounts, Assets, Contacts, etc. We also have the ability to create our own custom objects. 

Each Object is comprised of many things:
- Fields and Relationships: These are the pieces of data that make up our object
- Page Layouts
- Validation Rules
- Triggers

The Object Manager provides us a means of viewing, editing, deleting, and creating different types of objects within the system.
