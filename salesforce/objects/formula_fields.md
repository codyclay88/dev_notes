### Introduction to Formula Fields

Formula fields are a powerful tool that gives you control of how your data is displayed. 

Let's say you wanted to take two numeric fields on a record and divide them to create a percentage.

Maybe you want to take two dates and calculate the number of days between them. All these things and more are possible using formula fields.
