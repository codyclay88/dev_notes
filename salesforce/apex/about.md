Apex is a programming language that uses Java-like syntax and acts like database stored procedures. Apex enables developers to add business logic to system events, such as button clicks, updates of related records, and Visualforce pages. 

As a language, Apex is:
- Hosted: Apex is saved, compiled, and executed on the server -- the Lightning Platform
- Object Oriented: Apex supports classes, interfaces, and inheritance
- Strongly typed: Apex validates references to objects at compile time
- Multitenant aware: Because Apex runs in a multitenant platform, it guards closely against runaway code by enforcing limits, which prevent code from monopolizing shared resources
- Integrated with the database: It is straightforward to access and manipulate records. Apex provides direct access to records and their fields, and provides statements and query languages to manipulate those records. 
- Data focused: Apex provides transactional access to the database, allowing you to roll back operations
- Easy to use: Apex is based on Java-like idioms
- Easy to test: Apex has built-in support for unit test creation, execution, and code coverage. Salesforce ensures that all custom code works as expecting by executing all unit tests prior to any platform upgrades. 
- Versioned: Custom Apex code can be saved against different versions of the API
