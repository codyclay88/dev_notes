There are three core programmatic technologies to learn about as a Salesforce developer:
- Lightning Component Framework: a UI development framework similar to React or AngularJS
- Apex: Salesforce proprietary programming language with Java-like syntax
- Visualforce: A markup language that lets you create custom Salesforce pages with code that looks a lot like HTML, and optionally can use a powerful combination of Apex and JavaScript. 

### Lightning Components
The Lightning Component framework is a user interface development framework for desktop and mobile. As its name suggests, it's a component-based approach to UI development. Using prebuilt and custom Lightning components, you can quickly develop sleek and consistent UIs for your apps. 

If you're familiar with frameworks like AngularJS, React, or Polymer, you have a good idea of what to expect with Lightning components. The benefit, of course, is that Lightning components are ready to go with all your business data in Salesforce. 

### Apex


### Visualforce
The last major pillar of coding on the Salesforce platform is Visualforce. If you've done any web development, Visualforce will feel familiar to you. Visualforce lets you create and customize pages in Salesforce as well as integrate with other standard web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

There are significant differences between Lightning components and Visualforce pages. With Lightning components, you're developing components that can be pieced together to create pages. With Visualforce, you're developing entire pages at once. While Lightning components are newer and better for things like mobile development, there are several situations where it can make more sense to use Visualforce. 

### Heroku
You can also leverage the Heroku platform to develop any kind of app you want that integrates very tightly with the Salesforce platform.
