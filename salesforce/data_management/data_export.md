### Introduction to Data Export

You can easily export data from Salesforce, either manually or on an automatic schedule. The data is exported as a set of CSV files. Data export tools provide a convenient way to obtain a copy of your Salesforce data, either for backup or for importing into a different system. 

Salesforce offers two main methods for exporting data/

- Data Export Wizard: an in-browser wizard, accessible through the setup menu. It allows you to export data manually once every 7 days (for weekly export) or 29 days (for monthly export). You can also export data automatically at weekly or monthly intervals. In PE and DE, you can generate backup files only every 29 days, or automatically at monthly intervals only. 
- Data Loader: a client application that you must install separately. It can be operated either through the user interface or the command line. The latter option is useful if you want to automate the export process, or use APIs to integrate with another system.
