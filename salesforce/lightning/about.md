### What is a Lightning App?

An *app* is a collection of items that work together to serve a particular function. In Lightning Experience, Lightning apps give your users access to sets of objects, tabs, and other items all in one convenient bundle in the navigation bar. 

Lightning apps let you brand your apps with a custom color and logo. You can even include a utility bar and Lightning page tabs in your Lightning app. Members of your org can work more efficiently by easily switching between apps. What's more important to sales reps? Accounts, events, and organizations. How about sales managers? Reports and dashboards make the top of the list. 

Each Lightning app has navigation bar at the top of the page, letting your users: 
- Find what they need using item names for easy recognition
- Complete actions and access recent records and lists with a single click
- Personalize the navigation bar to suit the unique way they work

Think of the navigation bar as a container for a set of items and functionalty. It's always there, but the items change based on the app you're using.
