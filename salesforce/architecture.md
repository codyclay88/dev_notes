## What is the Salesforce Architecture?

Salesforce is a cloud company. Everything they offer resides in the trusted, multitenant cloud. 
The Salesforce platform is the foundation of all services. It's powered by metadata and made up of different parts, like data services, artificial intelligence, and robust APIs for development. 
All Salesforce apps sit on top of the platform. Prebuilt offerings, such as Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, along with apps that developers build on the platform, have consistent, powerful functionality. 
Everything is integrated. The platform technologies like Einstein predictive intelligence and the Lightning framework for development are built into everything Salesforce offers and everything we build. 

Metadata is data about data. This means that metadata defines the structure of your Salesforce org. If you think about an object like "Property", when your friends at DreamHouse use Salesforce, they input and view data about properties. For example, a property can be located in Bost, cost 500,000 dollars, and have 3 bedrooms. 
This information about a given property is stored in fields for a given object. Along with fields you can also have custom page layouts, security settings, and any other customizations. All these standard and custom configurations, functionality, and code in your org are metadata. 

APIs are pieces of software that allow other pieces of software to connect to each other and exchange information.
